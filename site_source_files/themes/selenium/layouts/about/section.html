            <h2>History of Selenium</h2>
            <p class="body">The story starts in 2004 at ThoughtWorks in Chicago, with Jason Huggins building the Core mode as "JavaScriptTestRunner" for the testing of an internal Time and Expenses application (Python, Plone). Automatic testing of any applications is core to ThoughtWork's style, given the Agile leanings of this consultancy. He has help from Paul Gross and Jie Tina Wang. For them, this was a day job.</p>

The Conservancy has reduced the management overhead associated with creating our own, dedicated legal entity.                     The majority of sponsorship funds go directly towards supporting the Selenium project, such as server, software and conference expenses.</p>
