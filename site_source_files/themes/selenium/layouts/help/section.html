    <h2>User Group</h2>
    <p>
        The first place where people ask for help about Selenium is the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/selenium-users">Official User Group.</a>
        Here, you'll find that most of the time, someone already found the problem you are facing right now,
        and usually reached the solution for which you are looking.
    </p>

    <p><i>Note: Please make sure to search the group before asking for something. Your question likely won't get answered if it was previously answered in another discussion!</i></p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Chat Room</h2>
    <p>
        The best place to ask for help is the user group (because they also keep the information accessible for others to read in the future).
        However, if you have a very important (or too simple) issue that needs a solution ASAP, you can always enter the IRC
        <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23selenium">chat room.</a>
        You might just find someone ready to help on #selenium at Freenode (irc.freenode.net). There is more info about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irc">IRC on wikipedia.</a>
    </p>

    <p>The #selenium IRC log archive is available at <a href="https://freenode.logbot.info/selenium">logbot</a>.</p>

<div class="section dark-background">
    <h2>Bug Tracker</h2>
    <p>
        Selenium's <a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues">Bug Tracker</a> can be used to log new bugs,
        check the status of an existing one or as inspiration to help make Selenium better.
    </p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Commercial Support</h2>
