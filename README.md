# Selenium Site and Documentation

This is the repository used to build and publish the official Selenium [website](https://selenium.dev).

## Quick start

We use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to build and render the site and docs,
which are two separate Hugo projects.

After cloning the repository, if you want to make changes to the
site, work on the `site_source_files` directory. To make changes to the docs,
switch to the `docs_source_files` directory. To see a live preview of your
changes, run `hugo server` on each directory.

```shell
% cd site_source_files/docs_source_files
% hugo server
```
